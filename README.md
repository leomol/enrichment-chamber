# Enrichment chamber
CAD files and assembly instructions for an enrichment chamber as in the picture below.<br>
All the floors, the ladders, and the maze are removable.<br>
Code to create the cad files programmatically (including option to adjust the kerf) is provided in `main.m`.<br>
Mazes can be designed with simple text instructions (see 6 examples at the end of `main.m`).<br>
